# Description: This file contains the code for the Streamlit web app that recommends movies based on user input.
# this code is used to create a web app that recommends movies based on user input. The app uses a dataset of movies and their similarity scores to recommend similar movies to the user. The app allows the user to select a movie from a dropdown menu and then click a button to get recommendations. The app displays the recommended movies along with their posters. The app also includes a footer with information about the app and the developer.
